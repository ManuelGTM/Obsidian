        If you're interested in full-stack development, learn the basics of frontend technologies like React, Angular, or Vue.js.

    Web Security Basics:
        Learn about common web security threats and how to protect against them (e.g., HTTPS, secure coding practices).

    Testing:
        Explore unit testing and integration testing.
        Write simple tests for your backend code.

    Basic Deployment:
        Deploy your application to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, Vercel) or a cloud platform.
